### Building and Running
This project uses [gradle](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-gradle) as a build system. We recommend using Android Studio and importing as a project.

### Features
So far this app allows you to share your dreams in text format publicly with other users. You also have the option of setting certain posts to private so that other users can not see these posts.

Our app also includes the ability to change your public name for your posts.

### Getting Started
When first installing the app, please proceed to the profile page. Then, enter your public name.

Now try creating a post! You have the option of setting it to public or private. The audio functionality will be added in sprint 2 as planned.

On the feed page you can tap on posts to view them. If they are your own posts you can even edit them.

If its your own post, on the edit page, you can choose to delete it with the trash button!

Comments were not in this sprint and neither were likes.
